Force Directed Graph
Started: October 7, 2012

I started working on this project after getting interested using a
physics-based algorithm to draw a graph or tree in a pleasing way.

It currently does a passable job of simulating the physics of the graph
for a small number of nodes. My next goal is to create a function that will
traverse a tree and generate a corresponding graph. Most of the code for this
is written, but not yet working.
